testplan

testE:
	malloc randomly between 10 and 100 bytes until you reach 10000 bytes 
then free each pointer one by one.

	Test E was chosen because it was meant to show the coallescing of the free() function as it freed each block one by one.
	
testF: 
	malloc 10 bytes each time until 3000 bytes
	free every other block
	then malloc 11 bytes  up until you reach 50000 total bytes malloced
	Then free the remaning pointers one by one.

	TestF was included because it exhibits fragmentation where every other block of memory was freed, then blocks bigger than the size of each freed block 
	was malloced. So the malloc would search through each freed space, find the size to small then move on until it finally malloced it at the beginning of
